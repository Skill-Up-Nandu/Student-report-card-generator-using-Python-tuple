ðŸ“˜ Project Title: "Student Report Card Generator (Tuple-Based)"
ðŸ“¦ Data Structure

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to use TUPLES effectively to store, unpack and process structured data. The project simulates a simple Report_Card_Generator using  a list of student records stored as TUPLES. 


Use a list of tuples to store student records:

# Format: (name, (math, science, english), roll_no, *hobbies)
students = [
    ("Alice", (85, 90, 78), 101, "painting", "reading"),
    ("Bob", (72, 88, 91), 102, "chess"),
    ("Charlie", (95, 92, 89), 103, "football", "gaming")
]


ðŸŽ¯ FEATURES

- Unpack each tuple to extract scores and hobbies.

- Calculate average marks.

- Generate formatted report for each student.

- Save reports to a .txt file (optional).

- Print final class summary (highest scorer, etc.).
